Revise is a tool to ~re~build user interfaces and applications.


Motivation
----------

Revise embraces mutation: when things change, it knows exactly what needs to be updated and updates things in place.

It's inspired by build systems (specifically by [tup](http://gittup.org/tup/)), which need to understand how to rebuild
files when dependent files change.
